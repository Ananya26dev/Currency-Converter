# Currency Converter with React.js

Create a functional currency converter application using React.js. This tool allows users to input an amount, select the source and target currencies from a dropdown menu, and fetch the current exchange rate with a click of a button. The application displays flags representing the selected currencies to enhance visual clarity. Users can also click a swap button to easily switch between the source and target currencies, providing a dynamic and user-friendly experience.
